Abstract:
Between 2 and 6 annotators independently sentiment annotated a stratified random sample of 10,427 documents from the Slovenian news portals 24ur, Dnevnik, Finance, Rtvslo, and Žurnal24. These portals contain political, business, economic and financial content. The texts were annotated using the five-level Lickert scale (1 – very negative, 2 – negative, 3 – neutral, 4 – positive, and 5 – very positive) on three levels of granularity, i.e. on the document, paragraph, and sentence level.

Annotation: 6 annotators, it took more than a year to manually annotate the sample; instructions to annotators: „Please specify the sentiment from the perspective of an average Slovenian web user. How did you feel after reading the news?“; five-level Lickert scale (1 – very negative, 2 – negative, 3 – neutral, 4 – positive, and 5 – very positive)

Levels of granularity: Document level, paragraph level, sentence level

Sentiment allocation: Negative (if average of scores ≤ 2.4); neutral (if average of scores is between 2.4 and 3.6); positive (average of annotated scores ≥ 3.6)
